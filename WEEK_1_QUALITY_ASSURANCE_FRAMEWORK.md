## 🔧 **QUALITY ASSURANCE TOOLS**

### **🧪 TESTING FRAMEWORK:**
```typescript
// Week 1 - IdeaBankService Quality Tests
describe('IdeaBankService Quality Gates', () => {
  it('generates ideas within 2s performance target', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const result = await ideaBankService.generateIdea(prompt);
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(2000);
    expect(result.cost).toBeLessThan(0.10);
  });
  
  it('maintains cost controls under budget', async () => {
    const dailyUsage = await costMonitoringService.getDailyUsage();
    expect(dailyUsage).toBeLessThan(3.00);
  });
  
  it('preserves Week 8 collaboration features', async () => {
    const collaborationTest = await testCollaborationFeatures();
    expect(collaborationTest.status).toBe('OPERATIONAL');
  });
});
```

### **📈 PERFORMANCE MONITORING:**
```typescript
// Real-time Performance Tracking
export const Week1PerformanceMonitor = {
  trackAPIResponse: (duration: number) => {
    if (duration > 5000) alertService.performance('API_SLOW');
    if (duration > 2000) metrics.record('api_response_slow', duration);
  },
  
  trackBuildTime: (duration: number) => {
    if (duration > 5000) alertService.build('BUILD_SLOW');
    metrics.record('build_time', duration);
  },
  
  trackCostUsage: (cost: number) => {
    const dailyTotal = costService.getDailyTotal() + cost;
    if (dailyTotal > 3.00) alertService.cost('DAILY_BUDGET_WARNING');
    if (dailyTotal > 5.00) alertService.cost('DAILY_BUDGET_CRITICAL');
  }
};
```
