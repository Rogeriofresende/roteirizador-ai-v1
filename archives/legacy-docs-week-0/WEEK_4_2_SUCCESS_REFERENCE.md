## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### **Mission Context**
Week 4.2 was designed to implement comprehensive evidence-based validation practices to prevent false success reporting and establish a robust foundation for automated quality assurance.

### **Challenge Addressed**
Previous development cycles showed a critical gap where "build success" did not equate to "real functionality," leading to claims that couldn't be verified with concrete evidence.

### **Solution Implemented**
A three-IA coordinated approach implementing automated testing, real browser validation, and quality gates with continuous monitoring.

  return {
    domContentLoaded: navigation.domContentLoadedEventEnd - navigation.domContentLoadedEventStart,
    loadComplete: navigation.loadEventEnd - navigation.loadEventStart,
    totalLoadTime: navigation.loadEventEnd - navigation.navigationStart,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    browser: navigator.userAgent
  };
};
```
