## 🚨 **CURRENT STATUS**

### **📊 QUALITY GATES:**
- **Quality Gate 1:** ❌ **BLOCKED** - Runtime errors must be fixed first
- **Quality Gate 2:** ❌ **WAITING** - Cannot start until Gate 1 passes
- **Final Validation:** ⏳ **READY** - Protocol established for final check

### **👥 IA ASSIGNMENTS:**
- **IA Alpha:** 🔄 **ACTIVE** - Must fix 21 `logger.systemLog()` instances
- **IA Beta:** ⏳ **WAITING** - User validation after Alpha completion
- **IA Charlie:** ✅ **MONITORING** - Evidence validation protocol active

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### **📅 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (2-3 hours):**
1. **IA Alpha:** Fix all `logger.systemLog()` calls
2. **IA Alpha:** Provide evidence package with screenshots
3. **IA Charlie:** Validate fixes with independent verification
4. **Quality Gate 1:** Pass with concrete evidence

### **📅 SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS (3-4 hours):**
1. **IA Beta:** User journey validation with evidence
2. **IA Charlie:** Validate Beta evidence package
3. **Quality Gate 2:** Pass with user experience proof
4. **Final Validation:** Complete system readiness

---

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **🎯 EMERGENCY COMPLETION CRITERIA:**
- **Application loads:** ✅ No JavaScript errors
- **User can navigate:** ✅ Basic functionality working
