## 🎯 **INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### **PHASE 1: WEEK 8 PRESERVATION (CRITICAL)**

#### **🛡️ Protect Collaboration Features:**
```typescript
// Ensure these Week 8 features remain operational:
✅ Real-time collaboration sessions
✅ Multi-user script editing
✅ Share button functionality
✅ Participant management
✅ Chat and messaging system
✅ Real-time cursor tracking
✅ Comment system
✅ Session management
```

#### **📊 Integration Testing Required:**
- All 128 existing tests must continue passing
- Collaboration features smoke test before any changes
- Performance regression testing (maintain <3s build)
- User experience validation for existing flows

### **PHASE 2: V6.0 ENHANCED LAYER (ADDITIVE)**

#### **🚨 Risk Management Addition:**
- **Cost Management System** - Layer over existing infrastructure
- **Environment Validation** - Extend current deployment pipeline
- **User Migration Framework** - Enhance existing user experience
- **Emergency Protocols** - Add to existing error handling

#### **🏗️ Architecture Integration:**
```typescript
// V6.0 Enhanced additions to Week 8 foundation:
Week_8_Collaboration + Risk_Management_Layer = V6.0_Enhanced_System

├── Existing Collaboration (preserve 100%)
│   ├── CollaborationPanel.tsx ✅
│   ├── ShareButton.tsx ✅
│   ├── useCollaboration.ts ✅
│   └── Real-time infrastructure ✅
│
└── New Risk Management (additive)
    ├── Cost control systems (new)
